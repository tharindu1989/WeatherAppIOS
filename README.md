## Weather App

### Architecture Pattern 

MVVM - Model, View, ViewModel (Recommended by Apple and SwiftUI comes with MVVM build-in. Also its easy to unit test because of it contains all the business logics but not in views)

### Dependency

- Alamofire 5.6.2 (Simple and easy to use. Also it provide generic completion callback makes it easy to decode the response )
